# stringOpps
### DEBI_PROJECTS
It's the first trial to make module
##### which imported from cood.py to stringOpps.py
##### That can make 3 functions 
“Repeated Substring”, “Simple String Matching”, “is it a palindrome?” -and the repeated substring solved in to mainers
## you can use f(s) or fs(s):
for a given nonempty string s find a minimum substring t and the maximum number k, such that the entire string s is equal to t repeated k times.
## you can use is_palindrome(s):
for checking the string is palinrome or not
## you can use solve(a,b):
You will be given two strings a and b consisting of lower case letters, but a will have at most one asterix character. The asterix (if any) can be replaced with an arbitrary sequence (possibly empty) of lowercase letters. No other character of string a can be replaced. If it is possible to replace the asterix in a to obtain string b, then string b matches the pattern . If the string matches, return true else false.


#### this is the finale project for NTI pythion track.
